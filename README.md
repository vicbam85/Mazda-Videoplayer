# Mazda-Videoplayer
Videoplayer app for Mazda cars with Mazda Connect v55+

**It works better if you start the car without usb connected. Insert only the usb with movies. Stop the music player and then start the videoplayer.**

**To hear the video player sound select the active audio source as the same USB as the videos you are playing.  Pause audio or play a silent track then start the video and you will hear sound.**
